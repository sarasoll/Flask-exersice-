Hi This is me Soll,
I want too add a small note for me to avoid gitting in trupple next time I want to build a small project in Flask,
First I need to be shure that the main file of the project is split to two the APP.PY file and the ""templatets"" file, so the APP.PY can run... 
Secend the layout.html need to be added to the rest of the pages as a {% extends 'layout.html' %} {% endblock %} {% block body %} so the code can be minmal,
I added some nots that I remeber thrue the time that I am editing the code so thers a lots that I miss alredy... I'll keep writeing more instructions while I am compliting this projectðŸ˜‰
